#javascript and classes

JavaScript's relationship with classes is a bit interesting. Here's the breakdown:

Technically: JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype object. It doesn't have classes in the same way as Java or Python.
Syntactically: Starting with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), JavaScript introduced a class keyword. This is considered syntactic sugar - a way to write code that looks more like class-based languages.
Functionality: The class keyword doesn't provide any new functionality compared to prototype-based inheritance. It just makes the code look more familiar to programmers coming from class-based languages.
So, to answer your question:

JavaScript doesn't have classes in the strictest sense.
It has a class syntax that mimics class-based inheritance for better readability.


#OOP that means object oriented programming

what is object 
--->Collection of properties and methods
--->toLowerCase

why object oriented programming ?
--->To avoid code meshup

parts of oop
--->Object literal

-constructor function
-prototypes
-Classes
-Instances (new,this)
